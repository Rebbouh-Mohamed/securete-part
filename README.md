# Smart Monitoring & Control System - Architecture Overview

This document outlines two key solutions integrated into our smart monitoring and control system, focusing on environmental optimization and security efficiency.

## ðŸŒ€ Solution 1: Environment-Based Control with MQTT and Reinforcement Learning

### Overview
This solution focuses on real-time monitoring of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) and uses intelligent decision-making to control cooling systems efficiently.

### Components

- **Sensor Data Collection**:
  - Sensors measure temperature and humidity.
  - Data is sent to an MQTT server for lightweight and fast communication.

- **MQTT Server Role**:
  - Acts as a central broker for collecting sensor data.
  - Communicates with an HTTP API to store data and maintain a historical log for monitoring and analytics.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model**:
  - An RL model uses the real-time and historical environmental data to make optimal decisions about cooling system activation.
  - The goal is to reduce energy consumption while maintaining ideal environmental conditions.

## ðŸ“¸ Solution 2: Energy-Efficient Camera Surveillance with Face Recognition and LLMs

### Overview
This solution is designed to activate the camera system only when motion is detected, and to track individuals only when necessary. It enhances security while optimizing energy usage.

### Components

- **Motion Detection Trigger**:
  - Cameras are activated only when motion is detected in the monitored area.

- **Face Detection and Recognition**:
  - Once motion is detected, the system checks for a human face.
  - If a face is recognized as authorized, tracking may continue; otherwise, the camera shuts down to save energy.

- **LLM-Powered Report Generation**:
  - If an unauthorized person is detected, a Large Language Model (LLM) generates a detailed report.
  - These reports are useful for security auditing and automated incident documentation.

## âœ… Goals

- **Efficiency**: Reduce energy consumption using intelligent control and conditional activation.
- **Security**: Enhance surveillance with real-time face recognition and automated reporting.
- **Scalability**: Use lightweight communication (MQTT) and modular architecture for easier integration and scaling.
